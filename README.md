# 32-bit-pipelined-RISC-V-based-processor
A Verilog implementation of a pipelined RV32I core, supporting a subset of the RISC-V 32-bit integer instruction set. The design includes essential pipeline stages (instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back) to achieve efficient instruction processing and optimized performance.
